package Amanda::Paths;

=head1 NAME

Amanda::Paths - perl access to build-time configuration paths

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Amanda::Paths;

  my $filename = "$amlibexecdir/foo/bar";

This package is a means of getting all of the necessary variables provided
by configure into Perl scripts, without a bunch of boilerplate, and without
requiring config.status substitution for every .pm file.

All of the variables in @EXPORT will be automatically imported into
your module's namespace.  See the source, rather than the perldoc,
to find out what variables are available.
