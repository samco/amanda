package Amanda::Constants;

=head1 NAME

Amanda::Constants - perl access to build-time configuration values

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Amanda::Constants;

  my $default_config = $Amanda::Constants::DEFAULT_CONFIG;

This package is a means of getting all of the necessary variables
provided by configure into Perl scripts, without a bunch of
boilerplate, and without requiring config.status substitution for
every .pm file.  

This module does not automatically export any of its values.

See the source for the list of constants available.

=head1 API STATUS

Constants will not be removed from this file unless they are no longer available in the codebase.

=cut

# the 'warnings' pragma doesn't recognized exported variables as "used", and generates warnings
# for variables only used once.  We turn it off for this module.
no warnings;

# (keep this list sorted in alphabetical order, for ease of updates)
