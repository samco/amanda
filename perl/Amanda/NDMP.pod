=head1 NAME

Amanda::NDMP - interface to the Amanda NDMP proxy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Amanda::NDMP;

  eval {
    my $sock = Amanda::NDMP::connect_to_ndmp_proxy();
  };
  if ($@) {
    die "connecting to ndmp-proxy: $@";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The single function in this module, C<connect_to_ndmp_proxy>, connects to a
running C<ndmp-proxy> instance, starting the proxy if necessary, and returns
the connected TCP/IP socket.  The function uses the currently-loaded
configuration to determine the TCP port the proxy should run on.

If there is a connection error, C<connect_to_ndmp_proxy> raises a Perl
exception.
